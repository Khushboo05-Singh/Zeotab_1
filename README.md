Overview
This project implements a rule engine using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to evaluate complex logical conditions based on user data. It allows users to define rules using expressions with logical operators like AND and OR, and supports combining multiple rules dynamically.

Key Features
Rule Parsing: Converts logical rule strings into AST structures.
Rule Combination: Multiple rules can be combined using AND or OR.
Evaluation: Evaluates rules against user data, supporting conditions like age > 30 or salary > 50000.
Precedence Handling: Ensures correct evaluation of operators based on precedence rules.# Zeotab_1
